# CodeGuild 🛡️⚔️

CodeGuild is an open-source, hybrid autonomous AI coding framework.

It allows developers to delegate planning, coding, and validation tasks
to AI agents using either:
- Free cloud-based models (default)
- Local AI models (power users)

## ✨ Why CodeGuild?

- No mandatory paid APIs
- Cloud + local hybrid support
- Open-source and community-driven
- Built for real developers, not hype

## 🎮 How It Works (High Level)

1. You describe a task
2. AI agents plan the work
3. Code is written and validated
4. Changes are returned safely

## 🧠 Modes

- **Cloud Mode** (default)  
  Uses free-tier cloud models with rate limits.

- **Local Mode**  
  Uses locally running AI models (Ollama / LocalAI).
