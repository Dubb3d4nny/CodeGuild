# CodeGuild Vision 🛡️⚔️

## 1. The Core Idea (Easy)

CodeGuild exists to give developers **a guild, not a gatekeeper**.

Instead of locking power behind paid APIs or heavy infrastructure, CodeGuild is designed so:

* Anyone can start for free
* Power scales with skill, not money
* The community grows the system together

CodeGuild is not a product first.
It is a **shared tool**.

---

## 2. The Problem We’re Solving (Easy)

Modern AI coding tools often:

* Require paid subscriptions
* Centralize power on one server
* Hide how things actually work
* Burn out maintainers with cloud costs

This creates a world where:

* Beginners are locked out
* Open source becomes fragile
* Knowledge is hidden behind convenience

CodeGuild rejects this model.

---

## 3. The Hybrid Philosophy (Medium)

CodeGuild follows a **Hybrid Model**:

### Cloud Mode (Default)

* Uses free-tier cloud models
* Zero setup for users
* Rate-limited but accessible
* Ideal for learning, demos, and light tasks

### Local Mode (Advanced)

* Runs AI models on the user’s machine
* Unlimited usage
* Higher hardware cost
* Optional, never required

This ensures:

* No single point of failure
* No forced payment
* No maintainer burnout

---

## 4. Roles Inside the Guild (Medium)

CodeGuild treats AI as **NPCs**, not replacements.

### Human Roles

* **Guild Master**: Maintainers and core contributors
* **Adventurers**: Users solving real problems
* **Craftsmen**: Contributors improving tools

### AI Roles

* Planner Agent – breaks tasks into steps
* Builder Agent – writes code
* Validator Agent – tests and checks quality

Humans stay in control.
AI assists.

## 5. Learning Through Transparency (Medium)

Every action in CodeGuild should be:

* Inspectable
* Reviewable
* Explainable

Users should be able to:

* See why a change was made
* Learn from AI decisions
* Modify workflows freely

CodeGuild is also a **teaching system**.

---

## 6. Open Source First, Always (Hard)

CodeGuild is open source by design, not marketing.

This means:

* Clear licensing (MIT)
* No dark patterns
* No hidden paywalls
* No vendor lock-in

If CodeGuild grows, it grows **with the community**, not above it.

---

## 7. Sustainability Without Exploitation (Hard)

CodeGuild avoids the common trap:

> "Free product, unpaid maintainer, infinite users"

Instead:

* Compute is optional and distributed
* Heavy usage is opt-in
* Costs are transparent

Sustainability comes from:

* Contributions
* Education
* Optional enterprise usage

Not from pressure.

---

## 8. The Long-Term Goal (Very Hard)

The long-term vision is a world where:

* AI coding is a shared skill
* Not a subscription advantage
* Open source tools are powerful again
* Developers understand their tools deeply

CodeGuild aims to be:

> A guild where humans and AI build together.

---

## Final Principle

**Power should be earned through understanding, not unlocked by payment.**

That is the CodeGuild way.
